## Installing / Getting started

A Homebrew package manager can be used to install Python 3 on MasOS.

  1. Go to brew.sh, select the start download code for Install Homebrew, then press Cmd+C to copy it to the clipboard.
  2. Open the Terminal.app window, insert the Homebrew start load code, then press Enter. The Homebrew installation will start and will be completed in a few minutes.  
  3. When the installation is complete, confirm the request "The software has been installed".
  4. Go back to the terminal, press Enter to continue the installation of Homebrew.
  5. Upon request from Homebrew specify a password to complete the installation and press Enter.
  6. Then the necessary files will be downloaded within a few minutes, after which you will need to return to the terminal window.

After installing Homebrew, you need to go back to the terminal and execute the command:

```shell
brew install python3
```

The command initiates the download and installation of the latest version of Python. When completed, Python 3 will be installed in the operating system.

To see if the program is installed correctly, you need to check the availability of Python from the terminal:

1. Open the terminal by running Terminal.app
2. Enter Python 3 and press Enter
3. The help text from the Python package manager (pip) should appear. If an error message appears after starting pip3, you must follow the Python installation steps from the beginning
